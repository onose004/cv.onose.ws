  abstract={Preventing pressure ulcer is one of important issues in nursing cure. Our project has tried to estimate and reduce the risk of pressure ulcer using a sheet-type pressure sensor. However, we found that body-pressure dispersion cushions that were inserted between bed and patient interfere with accurate sensing through preliminary experiments in an elderly care facility. To solve this issue, we are implementing a garment-type pressure sensor that measures directly the pressures that are applied onto the human skin. We compared the detection performance of pressure value put on body surface by evaluating accuracies of posture classification using bed-sheet and garment-type pressure sensors with 20 users. The garment-type sensor could succeeded to classify more accurately than the ones of the bed-sheet-type sensor in the classification task of postures using both of sensors. We confirmed that the garment-type pressure sensor has higher detectionability than the bed-sheet-type sensor when dispersion cushions are inserted. }

  abstract={This study proposes a system to visualize the body-pressures applied to body parts in a bed, with textile pressure sensors to support caregivers to learn posture change skill for pressure ulcer prevention. As the result of an evaluation with 21 nursing students, the comparison group using our system for learning showed better scores than ones of the control group with skill to understand the body-pressure distribution of sub-body parts: head (6/6, 100%) and right leg (3/6, 50%).}

A garment-type pressure sensor proposed in this paper successfully detected body-pressure changes regardless cushion replacement as the sensor could classify more accurate score in the classification task of postures using both of sensors.}

  abstract={Our project is estimating and reducing the risk of pressure ulcers using bed-sheet-type textile pressure sensors. However, body-pressure dispersion cushions interfere with accurate sensing and cause such problems as indistinct body-pressure changes, blurred body shape, and unmeasurable body-pressure changes. To solve these issues, we implement a garment-type pressure sensor that measures the pressures that are directly added to the human skin. Our sensor successfully detected the body-pressure changes that are overlooked by bed-sheet-type sensors, avoided body-pressure shape vagueness, and measured the pressure increase depending on the body part lift-up by cushion use through an experiment with 20 subjects.}

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
